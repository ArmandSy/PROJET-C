## PROJET C

A school project which goal was to simulate a city's traffic in the Unix shell, as a first step to learn C language programming.  

We've chosen to replicate Konigsberg's map in order to have an interesting dynamic with boats, cars, pedestrians, rabbits, tramways and helicopters traveling through the map. 

Once the program is launched you can choose within two modes : 

- Normal
- Danger

The main difference between the two modes is the traffic density (entities spawn more often in the Danger mode), and at the beggining of the Danger mode, there's a crash occurring between a car and a tramway.

The spawns of the entities are completly randomized, so each time you launch the program you get an unique result.

Although, depending the Unix version you're using, the rendering might look different.
